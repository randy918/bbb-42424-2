        Oklahoma's premier therapeutic riding program. Founded by Linda Barron and originally located in
        Claremore, Bit by Bit began as a way to make a dif&shy;ference in the lives of individuals with
        special needs through equine therapy.</h2>

    <h2 class="center-left">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOver the years, the program has relocated to Oologah
        and expanded to serve over 70 students, offering thera&shy;peutic riding lessons to children and
        adults living with a variety of special needs. One thing hasn't changed: the commitment to making a
        difference in riders' lives. This is possible thanks to over 150 volun&shy;teers, nearly 20 horses,
        and generous support from donors. Together, we make strides for those with
        special needs!<br></h2>

            alt="Warning!"><br>The benefits of thera&shy;peutic horseback
        riding are many and varied. Because the horse gently and rhythmically moves the rider's body in a
        manner similar to a human gait, riders with physical disabilities often show improve&shy;ment in
        flexibility, balance, and muscle strength.</h2>
    <h2 class="center-left">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor individuals with mental or emotional disabilities,
        the unique relationship formed with the horse can lead to increase confidence, patience, and
        self-esteem. Educational goals like letter and color recognition can be incorporated into riding
        activities. Lessons also provide a positive social experience for students as they inter&shy;act
        with volunteers, staff members, other riders, and horses.</h2>
    <h2 class="center-left">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspResearch shows that individuals of all ages who
        participate in equine-assisted activities and therapies can experience physical and emotional
        rewards. </h2>
